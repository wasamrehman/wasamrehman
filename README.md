Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

Full Stack Developer | AI Automation Engineer | Computer System Engineering B.S.

🚀 Professional Snapshot

Highly analytical Full Stack Developer and AI Automation Engineer with 5+ years of experience specializing in high-performance web architecture (React, Tailwind) and data-driven decision-making. Expert in leveraging Gemini API and cross-platform development (Flutter, Firebase) for complex, real-time data solutions, including infrastructure analysis and conversion rate optimization. Proven track record of delivering measurable business impact, including 95% efficiency gains and double-digit conversion improvements. My focus is on building robust, scalable systems where software engineering meets data intelligence.

💻 Core Domains and Expertise

Based on my B.S. in Computer System Engineering, my work is centered around the following high-impact domains:

I. AI-Driven Systems & System Architecture

Multimodal AI: Applying the Gemini API for computer vision and classification (e.g., visual road distress combined with sensor data).

Serverless Architecture: Designing and scaling real-time back-ends using Firebase (Firestore) for high-volume data ingestion from distributed mobile clients.

Signal Processing & IoT: Integrating and validating data from physical sensors (accelerometer/GPS) to calculate metrics like the International Roughness Index (IRI).

II. High-Performance Web & Mobile Engineering

Front-End Engineering: Expert in modern frameworks (React, Redux, D3.js) focused on performance optimization and complex data visualization.

Cross-Platform Development: Building production-ready, native-feeling mobile apps using Flutter.

System Performance: Core competency in reducing load times (e.g., 45% reduction) and ensuring enterprise-grade performance.

✨ Featured Portfolio Projects

The following projects showcase my ability to solve complex problems with measurable results:

1. AI-Driven Infrastructure Pavement Condition Index (PCI) Analyzer

Focus: Automated computer vision and sensor fusion for road network health assessment.

Tech Stack: Flutter, Mobile Accelerometer Data, Firebase Firestore, Gemini API.

Impact: Reduced manual analysis time from 7 days to 4 hours per 100 miles (95% efficiency gain) and achieved a 22% improvement in predictive maintenance scheduling accuracy.
